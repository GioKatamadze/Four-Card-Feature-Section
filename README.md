## My process

1. Change background color of body
2. Add background images of grid divs
3. Create wrapper div
4. Add text
5. Give images sizes and styles in CSS
6. Give texts font styles in CSS
7. Create Grid layout for images

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Media Queries

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using Media Queries and Grid layout, the main challenge that I overcame was to create responsive page that would work on any screen and create layout of images and texts specifically like it is shown in design.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic and interactive projects
